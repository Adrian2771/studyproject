					<p>This application was designed to illustrate the right way to approach a job opportunity on a recruiting website. Unfortunately, the initial plan went wrong and the result was a collection of half cynical, half grotesque thoughts about the labour market, the Information Technology industry, about birth, death and the fate of mankind, in general. I apologize in advance if reading this page makes you feel more depressed than a speech held by <del>the former</del> the actual UK PM. So, in the section on your right, you might (not want to) find some so-called personal projects built with some common technologies in the IT field.

					<h3>Contact</h3>
					<p>Well, you cannot contact me since I don't even exist.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>But, if I were a living person, this would be my e-mail: <strong>john.doe@email.com</strong><br /></li>
						<li>And if I had a <em>Facebook</em> account, this would be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank"> the link</a> to it.</li>
						<li>A <em>Twitter account</em> would take you <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
						<li>And had I had a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank"><em>LinkedIn account</em></a>, I wouldn't have written a stupid page like this one.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
					However, you might think that if you fill in the form below, you'll be contacted by me. It is not really true, the form is just one of the assignment requirements. In the end, nobody can stop you from completing the form fields and pushing the send button, just to see what's happening (nothing, I'm telling you).
					</p>
					
					<form id="form1" method="post">

							Email:<br>

						</fieldset>
							<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Send" disabled>
					</form>

					<p>
						I don't want you to leave this page sad and upset. I'm quite sure the next videos will bring a smile to your face.

					<p>Ok, you’ve heard of Bootstrap, at least enough to prevent you from thinking that it's all about a start-up business that dreams of burying Nike and Adidas. But, you know what? I have seen hundreds of pages made by naive people like yourself. Pages made with Bootstrap. Out of these hundreds of pages, hundreds were better than yours. Don’t bother anymore, kid: there is a principle in electronics: zero really means zero and non-null potential is somewhere around +5 volts. You are way too close to zero to even dare hoping for 5 volts. Give up. I'm not going to click your goddamn <a href="projectPages/AssignmentYeti_v2/index.html" target="_self">h2 level, project link</a>. And I won't take a look at the <a href="img/agency.png" target="_blank">layout pattern</a> that you have used without asking permission from your teacher.

					<p>Let's move to the <strong>next project</strong>. Wow! A page dedicated to some basic programming concepts! Really? Who, for fork's sake, would give a dime about it? Could you sell your page for a beggar's lunch? I knew it. If you thought you impressed someone with your interest in algorithms and other kindergarten level programming techniques, well, think again. You'll impress me when you build a fully responsive, 500 pages complex website in less than 48 hours. Database included. Pixel perfect and ready to go live. Like Magneto (not Magento!) said in X-men, to a supporting actor: if you're talented, I will use you. If not, there's a door behind you. Use it and farewell!

					<p><strong>The third project</strong> is a so-called study project, dedicated to learning PHP language. Wait, did you say PHP? I bet it's procedural PHP. Am I right? Never mind. It's sad to see how someone who’s not stupid enough to try and sell sausages to a vegan has started an endless fight with the heredoc constructions and code lines embedded in conditional statements, on the gloomy background of an already ancient programming language.

					<p>The plain PHP is dead, young Skywalker. Didn't they tell you that? If you want to keep it alive and keep yourself alive along with it, you'll have a long way to go. The next five years would not be enough for you to learn a professional PHP framework. And keep this in mind: there's no life for you in the PHP world without mastering a professional framework. Now, go out and find another playground.

					<p><strong>The <del>third</del> fourth</strong> and, thank God, the last project: a C++ program for mathematical calculus. A console application, isn't it? If she were still alive today, my grandma would use it for her weekly shopping basket. But she's dead and you might scare someone to death if you dare to run your code on a 7 inch tablet. Let's put it straight, young man: the technological race has started long before you were born.

					 <p>You, and other 7 billion human beings, have lost the race. You, and other millions of wannabes, may think you're young enough, strong enough and willing to learn enough to narrow the gap in order to become skilled and, eventually, rich and sociopathic or, in other words, a coder. The sad truth is you're not. You are sentenced to a life-lasting captivity as a customer of the IT industry, not as an IT professional. You may wish to thank the price lowering process for that: the more trivial technology has become, the more stupid and estranged people have become. Besides that, life's beautiful.
